GeoRondo

RULES

In this browser game, the player will be given a geography question for each letter
of the alphabet A-Z. The answer will start with the highlighted letter. The player
must type in their answer and hit enter; if they are correct, they will get one point.
The player also gets three skips, which can be used by clicking the skip button or by
submitting 'pass' as their answer. There is also a time limit. At the end, the player's
total points are tallied up, and they are placed on the leaderboard if their score and time is sufficient.
Login to have your name on the leaderboard!

HOW TO RUN

Simply open index.html in a browser of your choice.
